### Added

- Integration now reports node status and conditions, as `condition.{Name}` (e.g. `condition.Ready`, `condition.PIDPressure`).
- Added new KubeStateMetricsNamespace parameter to restrict discovery of KSM pod to a particular namespace.
  * This should help reduce load in the control plane for clusters with many pods and/or nodes.
- Added `unschedulable` metric to K8sNodeSamples
- Added `podIP` metric to K8sPodSample
